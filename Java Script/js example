9. Conditional Statements
What is the difference between if and else if?
if is the first condition the console check and compare, the else if is the second and so on conditions to check in case the main condition was false, and if else could be redundance 

Identify the issue in the following code:
let age = 25;
if (age > 30) {
  console.log("Older than 30");
} else if ((age = 30)) {
  console.log("Exactly 30");
} else {
  console.log("Younger than 30");
}
The mistake is in the first if else, the (=) used, it should be === to compare the value and the date type
Correct the mistake in the above code.
let age = 25;
if (age > 30) {
  console.log("Older than 30");
} else if ((age === 30)) {
  console.log("Exactly 30");
} else {
  console.log("Younger than 30");
}
10. Switch Statements
What will be the output of this switch statement if today is Monday?

  case 1:
    day = "Monday";
    break;
  default:
    day = "Invalid day";
}
console.log(day);
Monday

How does the break statement work in a switch case?
It pass the console to the next case statement 
What happens if you forget to include a break statement in a switch case?
When the console find the first true condition as an output, it would run any case after the true one even though it/they were false.
