              Hi, I'm Seward Jihad Shorman, a passionate programmer, designer,
              teacher, and content creator with a strong background in Java, C#,
              and Python. I specialize in full-stack web and mobile development,
              with experience in problem-solving, AI, and deepfake detection. My
              journey in tech has been driven by curiosity and a love for
              innovation, constantly pushing me to explore new technologies and
              improve my skills. I enjoy working on challenging projects,
              whether it’s developing applications, refining algorithms, or
              designing intuitive user experiences. Beyond coding, I’m
              passionate about teaching and writing, helping others learn and
              grow in the tech field. My goal is to build impactful solutions,
              continuously evolve as a developer, and contribute to projects
              that make a difference in the world of technology.
